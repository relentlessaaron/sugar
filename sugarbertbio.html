Upon inquiry, Tony revealed that he was on his way to boxing practice. Being naturally competitive, Bert replied “You can’t box. I bet you can’t beat me.” This challenge was Bert’s introduction to the world of boxing. After realizing Bert’s great skill and potential, Chico Rivas took him under his wing and taught him more about boxing and earning respect both inside and outside of the ring. Bert quickly earned the name “Sugar Bert” due to his boxing style and quick hands and feet. His talent earned him awards at competitions such as the Florida Sunshine State Games and Golden Gloves. His success allowed him to meet and train with some of his idols, including Sugar Ray Leonard, Alexis Arguello, Sugar Bert and Trevor Berbick.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>Bert’s life changed when his father was diagnosed with cancer. He worked hard to take care of his father, while attending school at Dillard High School and still pursuing his amateur boxing career. The death of his father changed his life because it inspired him to train harder and do better. After graduating from high school, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to further his boxing career. There, he met Tedd Grace and Bernard Styles, who became his mentors and helped shape him into a better boxer. Bert’s life changed again when his daughter, Blaire Kristin Wells, was born. Her birth made him focus more on being a father and a provider, and less on being a boxer, causing him to hang up his boxing gloves.</p><p><br></p><p>Sugar Bert’s return to boxing was as a coach. Years after his daughter’s birth, he got a call from Bernard Styles, a coach at Paul Murphy Boxing Gym at the time, asking him to coach amateur boxers. Bert agreed, and not too longer after that – he began training professionals such as Anyetei Laryea, Charmine Carrington and Cortney Patterson, to name a few. In his travels, Sugar Bert met and talked with boxing writer and sports historian, Bert Sugar. Sugar Bert’s passion for boxing and coaching led him to create Sugar Bert Boxing Promotions.Type your paragraph here.</p><p><br></p><p>Copyright ©  Bert Wells. All rights reserved.</p></div>
